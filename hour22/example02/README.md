# Folder layout for Node.js modules

Although no folder layout is enforced for Node.js modules a convention is as follows

* .gitignore - If you are using git excludes certain files from source control
* bin - contains any executables for the module
* examples - contains examples of the module in action
* lib - contains the code for the module
* package.json - JSON file containing information about the module
* test - contains tests for the module
* README.md - A README for the module
